Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 

Hi, I'm Xiongfeng Wang, also go by Alex.

I'm from Shanghai, China. It's always been my No.1 city. It's hard for me to list the splendidness of Shanghai but I'm sure you can feel it if you ever been to there.

I graduated from Purdue University major in Actuarail Science honor and Applied Statistics. To get prepared for the graduate school. It took JAVA & Python in my last semester.

My favorite food, I would say too many, mainly protein. I would say if you have 30 kinds of favored food and do the monthly cycle. You'd never lose any fun from a good appetite.

I have many hobbies, just as much as my favourite food. Sometimes I'm wondering if I should focus on one or two. But I'm that kind of person who loves to embrace new things. 
I guess this is when "I bit off more than I can chew". I enjoy photographing & travelling. I've started travelling since I was 6, at least twice a year.
Then I start to take photograph for my family. :) Now I take pics for the scene only.

I'm a really careful person so I code rather slowly - -. I tend to find better algo and keep optimizing my work. I think a lot.
